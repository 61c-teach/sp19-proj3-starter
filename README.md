# CS 61C Spring 2019 Project 3 Starter Code

Starter code for CS 61C's Project 3 (Constructing a 2-stage RISC-V datapath in Logisim) for the Spring 2019 semester. 

Starter code for Part 1 (ALU and RegFile) is in the `part1/` directory, and starter code for Part 2 (CPU) is in the `part2/` directory. The shell scripts for Part 2 copy the ALU and RegFile from Part 1 into the Part 2 directory, so there is no need for students to manually move/copy anything. 

The full spec for the project can be [found linked here](https://cs61c.org/projects/proj3/). 

The project is autograded on Gradescope.
